rdfs:comment """
The MOD Big Muff is inspired by the classic Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi(*).
This massive pedal has defined the sound of rock guitar!

Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s the fuzz revolution took place spicing up rock and roll music. The Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi* was one of its greatest representatives. 

Its rich tone and creamy, violin-like sustain made its name among legends of all times and styles - from Hendrix and Pink Floyd, to Sonic Youth and the White Stripes.

Features:
Modeled by MOD Devices
Based on the classic Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi*
